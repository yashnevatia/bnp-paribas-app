1. Ideally I would like to get intraday data and comprehensive financial news and then I would like to do a minute by minute analysis on the impact the ALERT would have.
2. But given the constraints of time and data I came up with the best I could.
3. My code is live at http://54.169.244.43
4. I wrote a simple api and simply deployed it on an ec2 instance and kept the process running. 
5. I could have deployed it on heroku or beanstalk, but I am assuming that was not a priority. 
6. I have also provided the IPython notebooks for code reference, as app.py is not particularly optimised.
