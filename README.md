1. Ideally I would like to get intraday data and comprehensive financial news and then I would like to do a minute by minute analysis on the impact the ALERT would have.
2. But given the constraints of time and data I came up with the best I could.
3. My code is live at http://bnpparibas-env.bcjsmeqvpx.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
4. I wrote a simple api using Flask and deployed it on elastic beanstalk.
5. I have also provided the IPython notebooks for code reference, as app.py is not particularly optimised.
